## Introduction

LaTeX is a document preparation system that uses plain text files with markup tags to define the structure and content of a document. It is widely used for typesetting academic papers, theses, and other technical documents due to its powerful handling of formulas, bibliographies, and cross-references.

This guide aims to help you master LaTeX from the basics to more advanced features.
